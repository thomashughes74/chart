<h1>New York City Marijuana Arrests show increase in percentage of minorities after legalization</h1>

<h2>Minority arrests went from "most" to "all" after decriminalization and legalization of marijuana. While the overall number of arrests fell accross the board, the percentage of those still arrested skewed even more unevenly towards Black and hispanic New Yorkers.</h2>

    Stop-and-frisk and other discriminatory policing policies led to a disproportionate arrest record for marijuana charges in New York City for decades, according to a 2018 report by Comptroller Scott Stringer. As reported by the NYPD, arrests fell dramatically for all racial categories tracked by the department after decriminalization in 2019. Arrests fell even further after marijuana was legalized in 2021.</p>
<p>
    Tracked as a percentage, the proportion of those still being arrested became even more uneven. In the third quarter of this year, no white people were arrested on marijuana charges, compared to 13 identified by NYPD as Hispanic, 10 Black people, and three Asian/Pacific Islanders.</p>
    <p>According to a 2020 report by the Drug Policy Alliance urging legalization, "the extreme racial disparities in New Yorkâ€™s marijuana arrest crusade...are the result of targeted criminalization and structural racism."</p>
    <p>The data suggests that these disparities have only increased after legalization.</p>
